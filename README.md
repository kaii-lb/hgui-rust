### About
This is an app i developed for my dad as he need a quick and easy (offline) way of converting dates between gregorian and hijri.

### Features
- Convert from hijri to gregorian year (and vice versa)
- Convert from gregorian to hijri year array (so multiple years aka from XXX to YYY, also vice versa)
- Convert between full dates (from dd/MM/yyyy  to dd/MM/yyyy, also also vice versa)
- Copies result to clipboard!
- Pretty much it :D

### Compiling to windows
- use the `gtk4-cross` 

### Special Thanks
To dad! as he inspired this whole journey and this is what really started my obsession with programming.
